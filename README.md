# awesome-MIT-AI-for-Climate-Change [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)
**Awesome-MIT-AI-for-Climate-Change** is a curated list of professors and other researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who are tackling climate change with machine learning (CCML)

Finding MIT professors in machine learning and climate change is difficult, because they are spread across various departments and research a wide breadth of optics. Whether you're applying for graduate school, look for collaborators, or inspiring projects - this list is intended to get you started by finding the right people.

This is a safe, open, and inclusive community. The list is most surely incomplete, so please add your favorite researchers through commenting in an issue or creating a pull request.
