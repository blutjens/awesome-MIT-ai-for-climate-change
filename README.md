# awesome-MIT-AI-for-Climate-Change [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)
**Awesome-MIT-AI-for-Climate-Change** is a curated list of professors and other faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who are tackling climate change with machine learning (CCML).

Finding people at the intersection of machine learning and climate change can be difficult, because they are spread across various departments and research a wide breadth of topics. Whether you're applying for graduate school, look for collaborators, or inspiring projects - this list is intended to get you started by finding the right people.

This is a safe, open, and inclusive community. The list is most surely incomplete, so please add your favorite researchers through commenting in an issue or creating a pull request.
